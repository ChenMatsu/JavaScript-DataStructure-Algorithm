### 03-ProblemSolving-Approach

- Objectives
  - Define Algorithm
  - Devise Plan to Solve Algorithm
  - Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer
---

- Algorithm: A **process** or **set of steps** to accomplish a certain task
  -  Almost everything in programming involves some kind of algorithm
  -  It is the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer

- Problem Solving
  - Understand the Problem 
    - => Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    - => What are the inputs that go into the problem
    - => What are the outputs that should come from the solution
    - => Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Enough Information to Solve)
    - => How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem
  - Explore Concrete Example
    - => Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
    - => Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should
    - => User Story / Unit Test
      - => Start Simple Examples
      - => Progress Complex Examples
      - => Explore with Empty / Invalid Inputs
  - Break It Down
    - => Explicity write out the steps you need to take
  - Solve/Simplify
    - Find the core difficulty in what you are trying to do
    - Temporarily ignore that difficulty
    - Write a simplified solution
    - Incorporate difficulty back in
  - Look Back and Refactor
