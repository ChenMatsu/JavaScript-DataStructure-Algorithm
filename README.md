# Singly Linked List
> Unidirectional

## Linked List
- Contains a head, tail and length property
- Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null (one node points one node)

## List vs Array
- List
  - Do not have indexes
  - Connected via nodes with a **next** pointer
  - Random access is not allowed
- Array
  - Indexed in order
  - Insertion and deletion can be expensive
  - Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
